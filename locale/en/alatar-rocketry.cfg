[entity-description]
thruster=A basic rocket engine optimized for sea level thrust. Necessary to launch rockets into space, and usable on space platforms to travel to other planets.
vac-thruster=A rocket engine optimized for thrust in the vacuum of space. Cannot be used to launch rockets, but can be used on space platforms to more efficiently travel to other planets.
nuclear-thruster=A solid-core nuclear thermal rocket engine. Requires advanced materials to construct and can only be used in the vacuum of space, but is highly efficient and only requires water as an input.
